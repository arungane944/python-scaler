## Class

1. It's a blueprint to create objects
2. int, float, strings are the class
3. Class has the attributes and behaviour


#### Constructor
1. Constructor are the special methods used to create and initalize an object of the class
2. Accessing instance attributes with self

```bash
class Car:

# !! __ -> double underscore are called as dunder
    
def __init__(self): # Constructor
    print("this will always print")

audi = Car()    # this will always print
benz = Car()    # this will always print
```


## Object

1. a = 5. Here, 5 is the object
2. Object has the all the properies of the class eg:, In String object, we have all the methods it provided

```bash
honda = Car()
print(type(honda))
```


- âœ¨ **Feature 1:** Description of the first key feature.
- ðŸš€ **Feature 2:** Description of the second key feature.
- ðŸ”§ **Feature 3:** Description of the third key feature.

## Abstraction

1. only shows the essentials information and hiding the details
2. Internal working aren't exposed


## Encapsulation

1. Building of all the methods that can act on the object of the data
2. car can have colors, brakes and lot of methods

## Inheritance

1. Inherting the properties from parent class
2. 




## Polymorphism

1. same class methods can work differently for different objects
